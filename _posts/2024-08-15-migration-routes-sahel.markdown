title: "Shifting Migration Routes Through the Sahel"

Migration patterns across the Sahel have undergone significant changes in recent years, driven by a combination of political instability, economic pressures, and environmental factors. These shifts have profound implications for both origin and destination communities.

During my research in the region, I've documented how traditional routes that have existed for centuries are being abandoned in favor of more dangerous but politically viable alternatives. The human cost of these changes is often overlooked in policy discussions.

## The Role of Documentation

Photography plays a crucial role in documenting these stories that might otherwise remain invisible to international audiences. Each image tells a story of resilience, adaptation, and sometimes tragedy.

The challenge for journalists and researchers working in this space is to balance the need for documentation with respect for the dignity and privacy of the individuals whose stories we're telling. This ethical dimension of our work cannot be understated.

## Community Perspectives

Local communities along these routes have developed sophisticated understanding of migration flows and their impacts. Their insights are invaluable for anyone seeking to understand the broader patterns at play in the region.
