This is an example blog post that demonstrates the new al-folio inspired styling. The post includes a featured image, tags, author information, and rich text formatting.

## Rich Text Support

The blog now supports beautiful typography with proper spacing and hierarchy. You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, and even `inline code`.

### Images in Posts

Images are automatically styled with rounded corners and subtle shadows:

### Code Blocks

Code blocks are nicely formatted with syntax highlighting support:

```javascript
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello from the blog!");
}
```

### Blockquotes

> This is a beautifully styled blockquote that stands out from the regular text. It has a subtle background and left border.

### Lists

The formatting also supports:

- Beautiful bullet lists
- With proper spacing
- And consistent styling

1. Numbered lists work great too
2. With proper typography
3. And clean hierarchy

This new styling brings a more professional and academic feel to the blog, inspired by the al-folio Jekyll theme while maintaining the clean, minimal aesthetic of the rest of the site.
