The discovery of gold in Niger's remote regions has sparked a modern-day gold rush, drawing thousands of miners to previously quiet desert towns.

This documentary series explores the environmental and social impacts of artisanal mining, following both the miners seeking fortune and the communities adapting to rapid change.

Through intimate portraits and environmental documentation, the project reveals the complex realities of resource extraction in one of the world's poorest countries.
